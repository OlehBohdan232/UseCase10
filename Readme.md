Documentation for StringUtils in com.example.usecase10
1. Application Description
   The StringUtils class within the com.example.usecase10 package provides utilities for string validation. Specifically, it helps ensure strings meet specific formatting rules, such as containing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, special characters, and adhering to a maximum length.

2. Regex Implementation Description
   StringUtils uses regular expressions (regex) to validate strings. The regex patterns within the utility check for:

At least one uppercase character.
At least one lowercase character.
At least one digit.
At least one special character (e.g., punctuation).
Absence of any whitespace characters.
All these conditions need to be met for a string to be considered valid. Additionally, the utility ensures that the input string's length does not exceed the specified maximum length.

3. Running the Project Tests Locally
   (Note: This section is generic as no specific test-running mechanism was provided. Adjust as per your actual project setup.)

Ensure you have the required development environment set up, including the appropriate version of the programming language and any necessary libraries or dependencies.
Navigate to the root directory of the project.
If tests are not already present, write tests to verify the functionalities provided by StringUtils.
Use the appropriate test runner or build tool command to run the tests. For example, if using Gradle, you might use ./gradlew test.
Review the test results for any failures or issues, and address them accordingly.
